# Al-BurƒÅq: Next-Generation Shariah Compliance Platform

> ‚ÄúVerily, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due.‚Äù (Quran 4:58)
> In a world driven by profit, Al-BurƒÅq ensures your financial products honor the sacred trust of Shariah compliance‚Äîswiftly, transparently, and collaboratively.

## Problem
In contrast to conventional banks‚Äîwhere virtually any client request can be processed immediately‚ÄîIslamic banks must ensure that every transaction is structured around a Shariah-compliant product rather than simply lending money. The real question, then, is whether every product or client request in Islamic finance is actually designed from the ground up to meet Shariah requirements.

The single **BIGGEST** challenge facing Islamic banks compared to their conventional counterparts is the complex, never-ending process of **developing**, **vetting**, and **validating** **NEW** products, contracts, and financial practices so that they remain fully AAOIFI-compliant in real time.

<br>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Introduction

**Al-BurƒÅq** is an AI-and-blockchain-powered platform designed to **streamline** and **accelerate** the validation of Islamic finance products under AAOIFI standards. What once took months of paperwork and layered approvals now completes in **minutes**, without sacrificing rigor or transparency. By combining advanced AI drafting, human-smart review, and a permissioned blockchain governance layer, Al-BurƒÅq empowers Islamic banks to innovate confidently, serving clients with faith-aligned offerings faster than ever.

* **Now**: End-to-end workflow‚Äîfrom product concept to final sign-off‚Äîin **under an hour**.

### 2. Rock-Solid Shariah Assurance

* **Automated AAOIFI Alignment**: AI retrieves and embeds the exact clauses, calculations, and risk metrics required by AAOIFI standards.
* **Scholarly Oversight**: Human-in-the-loop review ensures every contract gains scholar endorsement before going live.

### 3. Immutable Transparency

### 4. Collaborative Governance

* **2-of-3 Multisig Voting**: Internal Shariah board, National Shariah board, and Central Bank nodes must endorse any new product‚Äîno single point of approval.
* **Fatwa Token DAO**: A lightweight on-chain DAO where scholars issue and vote on ‚Äúfatwa tokens‚Äù to update rules‚Äîonce quorum is reached, all nodes refresh automatically.

### 5. Country-Wide Dissemination

* Approved contracts trigger automatic notifications to **all** Islamic banks in the client‚Äôs country, fostering rapid adoption and standardized offerings.

| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Product Design & Internal Review | Create concept note, risk analysis, draft contracts; convene internal board (weeks) | Enter concept in UI; AI drafts contracts; scholars review inline (minutes)                  |
| 2. National Shariah Certification   | Compile dossier; submit to National Board; await fatwa (months)                     | Smart-contract submit: ballot pops up on blockchain nodes; 2-of-3 sign within minutes       |
| 3. Regulatory Authorization         | Submit certified documents to Central Bank; follow-up cycles                        | Central Bank node auto-receives on-chain record; signs digitally‚Äîno manual paperwork        |
